# Use Cases

## Overview

This repository contains curated examples of real-world use cases implemented using four popular configuration management tools:

- **SaltStack**
- **Puppet**
- **Chef**
- **BMC BladeLogic**

These examples are intended to serve as training data for a tool that will **convert legacy configuration scripts into Ansible playbooks**, facilitating modernization and standardization of infrastructure-as-code practices.
